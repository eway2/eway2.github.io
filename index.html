<h3>Saint Benedict: The Ultimate Hermit and First Monk <small>9/5/2019</small></h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="https://www.lorettochapel.com/cms/default/assets/Image/Saints/saint-benedict.jpg">
<p>Saint Benedict was a Father of the early Catholic Church and the first to start a monastic order. He started life in wealth, learning rhetoric in a university. When he saw his colleagues using rhetoric for evil, he left school and his fortune and became a hermit. After a few hermit wars, he started the first monastic order and wrote a book that is still used today to format the many orders around the world.</p>
